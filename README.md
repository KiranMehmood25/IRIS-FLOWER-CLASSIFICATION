# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION

In this project, I utilized the widely-known Iris dataset for a fundamental classification task. The dataset comprises measurements of sepal and petal lengths and widths for three distinct Iris species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The primary objective was to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying Iris flowers based on these measurements. The project involved an initial exploration of the dataset, preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and feature scaling, and the selection of a suitable classification algorithm. The chosen algorithm underwent training and evaluation, with the results presented through relevant performance metrics. The conclusion summarizes key findings, addresses encountered challenges, and suggests potential future improvements. The project, including code and resources, is available in a public repository for further exploration and replication.
